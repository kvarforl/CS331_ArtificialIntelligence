### [program1/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS331_AI/tree/master/program1)

The code in this directory contains search solutions for the chickens and wolves puzzle (demo [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/55981236/)). Algorithms demonstrated are **breadth first** search, **depth first** search, **iterative deepening depth first** search, and **astar** search.

### [program2/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS331_AI/tree/master/program2)

This directory contains code for a 4x4 game of Othello, with the option of using a **minimax** opponent. Starter code for Othello provided by Eric Kramer. Minimax implementation by me.

### [program3/](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS331_AI/tree/master/program3)

This directory contains a **Binomial Naive Bayes** classifier that distinguished positive yelp reviews from negative ones. **Bag of Words** technique was implemented by me (not using sklearn's CountVectorizer, as in the machine learning multinomial naive bayes classifier found [here](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning/tree/master/implementation2)).
