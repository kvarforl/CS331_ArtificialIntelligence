To run, use the following command:

```bash
python3 p1.py start1.txt goal1.txt bfs output.txt
```

You can also make p1.py an executable, and let it detect the correct python version.

```bash
chmod +x p1.py
./p1.py start1.txt goal1.txt bfs output.txt
```

For more help, run

```bash
python3 p1.py -h
```
